# üîß Fixed: File Access Issue in Rawtass

## Problem Diagnosis
The files were appearing greyed out because of **macOS App Sandbox** restrictions. Even though the `Rawtass.entitlements` file didn't explicitly enable the sandbox, Xcode was automatically applying sandbox entitlements during debug builds.

## Root Cause
```
Sandbox Entitlements (automatically applied by Xcode):
{
  "com.apple.security.app-sandbox" = 1;
  "com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-only" = 1;
  "com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only" = 1;
  "com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-only" = 1;
  "com.apple.security.files.bookmarks.app-scope" = 1;
}
```

This means the app can only access:
1. **Pictures folder** (read-only)
2. **Downloads folder** (read-only)  
3. **Files explicitly selected by the user** via file picker

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Default Directory
- App now starts in the **Pictures directory** by default (has sandbox access)
- Fallback to home directory if Pictures folder is not accessible

### 2. User-Friendly UI
- Added helpful messages when no images are found
- Clear instructions on how to access images:
  - Use folder button to select a directory
  - Navigate to Pictures folder
- "Open Pictures Folder" button for quick access

### 3. Sandbox-Aware File Access
- File picker integration for user-selected directories
- Proper security-scoped resource access for dropped files
- Clear visual feedback for accessible vs. restricted files

## How to Use the App Now

### For Users:
1. **Launch the app** - it will start in your Pictures folder
2. **To access other folders:**
   - Click the üìÅ folder button in the toolbar
   - Select any folder with images
   - The app will remember this choice
3. **Drag & drop images** directly onto the app
4. **Navigate using the breadcrumb path** at the top

### For Development:
The app works correctly within sandbox constraints. For production release, you have two options:

#### Option A: Keep Sandbox (App Store compatible)
- Current implementation works
- Users need to explicitly select folders
- App Store compliant

#### Option B: Disable Sandbox (Direct distribution only)
```xml
<!-- Remove from entitlements for unrestricted file access -->
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<false/>
```

## Files Modified
- `FileBrowser.swift`: Added smart defaults, helpful UI, sandbox-aware behavior
- `Rawtass.entitlements`: Configured for development with JIT support
- Debug output added to track file selection issues

## Testing Results
‚úÖ App launches successfully  
‚úÖ Pictures folder accessible by default  
‚úÖ File picker works for other directories  
‚úÖ Clear user guidance when no images found  
‚úÖ Build system works correctly  

The app is now **fully functional** within macOS security constraints! üéâ
