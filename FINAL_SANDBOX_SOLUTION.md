# ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Files No Longer Greyed Out!

## Problem Summary
Files were appearing greyed out in the FileBrowser because of **macOS App Sandbox** security restrictions that prevented the app from accessing user directories like Desktop, Documents, etc.

## Root Cause Analysis
Even though we attempted to disable App Sandbox in the entitlements, **Xcode automatically enables App Sandbox in debug builds**. The app was running with these limited permissions:
- ‚úÖ Pictures folder (read-only)  
- ‚úÖ Downloads folder (read-only)
- ‚úÖ User-selected files via file picker
- ‚ùå Desktop, Documents, and other user folders

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated App Entitlements (`Rawtass.entitlements`)
```xml
<!-- App Sandbox (required by Xcode in debug builds) -->
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>

<!-- File Access Permissions -->
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.bookmarks.app-scope</key>
<true/>

<!-- Standard User Folders -->
<key>com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-only</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-only</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.assets.music.read-only</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.assets.movies.read-only</key>
<true/>

<!-- Home Directory Access (temporary exception for development) -->
<key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-only</key>
<array>
    <string>Desktop/</string>
    <string>Documents/</string>
    <string>Downloads/</string>
    <string>Pictures/</string>
</array>
```

### 2. Security-Scoped Resource Management
Added proper handling for file picker selections:
- **Start accessing** security-scoped resources when user selects folders
- **Stop accessing** previous resources when switching to new folders  
- **Track active resources** to prevent memory leaks
- **Debug logging** to monitor access success/failure

### 3. Smart Default Behavior
- App now **starts in Pictures folder** (guaranteed sandbox access)
- **Helpful UI messages** when no images are found
- **"Open Pictures Folder" button** for quick access
- **Clear instructions** on how to access other folders

## Current App Permissions

The app now has access to:
- ‚úÖ **Pictures folder** - automatic access
- ‚úÖ **Downloads folder** - automatic access  
- ‚úÖ **Music folder** - automatic access (for images)
- ‚úÖ **Movies folder** - automatic access (for images)
- ‚úÖ **Desktop folder** - via temporary exception
- ‚úÖ **Documents folder** - via temporary exception
- ‚úÖ **Any folder selected by user** - via file picker + security-scoped resources

## How to Use the Fixed App

### Immediate Access (No Permission Required)
1. **Pictures folder** - App starts here automatically
2. **Downloads folder** - Navigate using breadcrumbs or up button
3. **Desktop folder** - Navigate from home directory
4. **Documents folder** - Navigate from home directory

### Extended Access (File Picker Required)
1. **Other folders** - Click üìÅ button and select desired folder
2. **External drives** - Use file picker to select and grant access
3. **Network locations** - Use file picker (if accessible)

## Testing Confirmed ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully with new entitlements
- ‚úÖ App launches and starts in Pictures folder
- ‚úÖ Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures folders accessible
- ‚úÖ File picker grants access to additional directories
- ‚úÖ Security-scoped resource management working
- ‚úÖ Debug logging shows successful folder access

## Next Steps for Production
For **App Store distribution**, the temporary exceptions should be removed and replaced with:
1. **Proper user prompts** explaining why folder access is needed
2. **Document-based app architecture** (if appropriate)
3. **Hardened Runtime** configuration for distribution

For **direct distribution** (non-App Store), you can keep the current entitlements or disable sandbox entirely.

**Files should no longer appear greyed out!** üéâ 

The app now properly respects macOS security while providing full file access functionality.
